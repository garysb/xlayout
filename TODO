SET:  If we recieved a geometry, the user is obviously trying to set the window
      or pointer to that value, in which case, why should they need to specify
      the --set commandline option.

EASE: We need to find an eligant way of letting the user define which type of
      easing methods they want to use and also let them set the ease duration.

      The ease option should also not require the --set option as the point of
      easing something is to set it to a new location in multiple steps.
