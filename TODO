REG:  Now that we have a working regular expression engine, we need to allow the
      program to return multiple results. eg. If a user does a --list --name,
      then we should apply the regex as a filter to the list. Also, if the user
      does and --info --name, then we should return multiple results of info. We
      could also add the option to control multiple windows at the same time.

REG:  Include the pcre regex engine also if the user has it on there system. We
      can then try parse with the cheapest one unless the regex syntax is wrong,
      then try use the other regex library. (aka. handle both syntaxes)

EASE: We need to find an eligant way of letting the user define which type of
      easing methods they want to use and also let them set the ease duration.

EASE: The ease option should also not require the --set option as the point of
      easing something is to set it to a new location in multiple steps. (not
      sure if this still happens, Need to check it!)

LIST: When listing windows with the short/default version, it would be good to
      try get the actual window being displayed instead of the window that the
      command created. Not sure if its possible without loads of dependancies.

CMD:  For some reason the --verbose option isnt working properly in its short
      form. Need to investigate further.

OUT:  The output of some of the functions needs to be tidied up and we need to
      go through all of the verbosity levels to see whats getting reported and
      when.
