-----xlayout installation guide-----

1) REQUIREMENTS: In order to install and use xlayout, you need the following:
  1A) Utilities needed to compile xlayout such as a c compiler like gcc.
  1B) The header files for X11.
  1C) The standard c libraries.
  1D) OPTIONAL: Installing libease will enable easing/tweening effects.

2A) SVN CHECKOUT: (http://anonyous@www.stroppytux.net/svn/xlayout/tags/<ver>/)
  When checking out a revision from subversion, you will need to have installed
  the automake utilities. Once checked out, run 'autoremake --install' within
  the root directory of xlayout. This will build the Makefiles and configure
  scripts needed to build xlayout.

2B) DOWNLOAD PACKAGE: (http://sourceforge.net/projects/xlayout/)
  The packaged source files located on Sourceforge already have the automake
  scripts run on them, and so, dont need to be run. Simply download the tar.bz2
  file and run 'tar -jxf xlayou-<version>.tar.bz2'.

3) BUILDING: (configure your environment, compile, then install xlayout)
  In order to build xlayout from source, start by configuring your environment.
  This is done by executing the './configure' script in xlayouts root directory
  with the configure options set. (Refer to './configure --help' for options.

  Once the configuration is done, run the 'make' command to compile the source.
  This will compile xlayout and set the required files to be installed.

  Now that you have xlayout compiled, run 'make install' to install xlayout,
  and the man pages and documentation into your system.
