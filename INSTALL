-----xlayout installation guide-----

Depending on how you get xlayout, there are two diferent installation methods.
With the version checked out from the subversion repository, you will need to
have the automake tools installed. With the tar.gz file from sourceforge or from
freashmeat, this has already been done for you.

xlayout has some optional libraries that it can use to enhance itself.
Installing libease will enable easing/tweening effects that will allow you to
animate pointer and window positioning/sizing. For further information about
libease, please go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/libease/
xlayout can also support regular expressions if your system has the regular
expression library installed. On most linux systems, it will be. xlayout uses
regex to allow you to use regular expressions when trying to find windows by
their name.

As most people that are less savvy tend to stick to Ubuntu, I will describe the
installation methods for Ubuntu. Please bare this in mind and change commands to
match your environment.

1.*** USING THE CHECKED OUT VERSION FROM svn.stroppytux.net ***
   *  If you downloaded the tar.gz version, skip to section 2.
   *  # sudo apt-get install automake libtool libx11-dev libxmu-dev build-essential
   *  # svn co http://anonymous@svn.stroppytux.net/xlayout/tags/0.9 xlayout-0.9
   *  Change into the root directory of xlayout (contains configure.ac)
   *  # aclocal # This generates your aclocal.m4 file.
   *  # autoheader # This generates the src/config.h.in template file.
   *  # automake --add-missing # This generates all the scripts for autoconf.
   *  # autoconf # This generates your configure script to compile xlayout.

2.*** USING THE tar.gz VERSION FROM sourcefore.net/freshmeat.net ***
   *  If you downloaded the subversion version, skip to section 3.
   *  # sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxmu-dev build-essential
   *  # cd /tmp # Change to temp directory. (Should be /usr/src but need to be root for that)
   *  # wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/xlayout/xlayout/xlayout-0.9/xlayout-0.9.tar.bz2
   *  # tar -jxf xlayout-0.9.tar.bz2 # Extract the contents (-j: bzip2 -x: extract -f: file)
   *  # cd xlayout-0.9 # Change into the xlayout source directory.

3.*** ALL USERS ONCE YOU HAVE COMPLETED SECTION 2 OR 3 ***
   *  # ./configure --help # Check which options you need. I use --prefix=/usr
   *  # ./configure <OPTIONS> # configure xlayout with your options.
   *  # make # Builds xlayout source into a binary file.
   *  # sudo make install # Installs xlayout, the header, and the man file.
