Xlayout is a simple utility for controlling X11 windows and pointer from the console or remotely. It can alter the geometry of a window, the position of the pointer, hide a window or send it to the top, list all windows, and get the current pointer position. For use in scripts, it has the ability to return a status result ("1" for error, "0" for success). It can also ease windows into location.
