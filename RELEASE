This release of xlayout focuses on stablising and adding regex.
 1) More updates have been made to refine the command line arguments to be more
    intuitive. You now dont need to force the --set flag and using no flags now
    returns the minimal window list.
 2) By default, the window list now only returns windows that have an associated
    command line value set. This still wont help you get an accurate list of
    valid window id's for windows being displayed, but it does give you a better
    idea of what windows are open. To display all the windows, use --verbose=8
 3) When running a command on a window specified by a name, create_window_named
    now now not only searches the XFetchName, but also the value of XGetWMName,
    the name and class of XGetClassHint, and the command used to start the app
    using XGetCommand.
 4) When searching for windows to perform actions on, you can now use a regex in
    the name option. This lets you search for windows containing words, or to
    specify windows who's names you arent completely sure of.
 5) The autoconf scripts have been updated to support version 2.65 of autoconf.
 6) xlayout now correctly gets its version numbers and contact/bug report detail
    from autoconf.
 7) Fixed a segfault triggered when the user specified both the --set and one of
    --top, --unhide, --hide together.

This release of xlayout is a major overhaul.
 1) Updates have been made to refine the command line arguments to be more
    intuitive.
 2) The custom build system has been replaced with automake to support cross
    platform compiling.
 3) xlayout now properly integrates into libease to provide smooth easing
    motions when the pointer is moved or the window resized or repositioned.
 4) The large struct used before has been broken down to better represent the
    data contained inside each section.
 5) Internal functions have been renamed to be more clearly understood.
