This release of xlayout is a major overhaul.
 1) Updates have been made to refine the command line arguments to be more
    intuitive.
 2) The custom build system has been replaced with automake to support cross
    platform compiling.
 3) xlayout now properly integrates into libease to provide smooth easing
    motions when the pointer is moved or the window resized or repositioned.
 4) The large struct used before has been broken down to better represent the
    data contained inside each section.
 5) Internal functions have been renamed to be more clearly understood.
